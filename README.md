Optical communication is a type of communication which uses light for the transmission of the signal. It is of two types one is optical fiber communication and wireless optical communication. In wireless optical communication the transmission medium can be air, water,etc. If the transmission medium is water then it is called Underwater wireless optical communications. The analysis of optical characteristics at sea water is done using double gamma function which fits good with Monte Carlo for different turbid seawater such as coastal and harbor water.
